You're going to need to install the JDK's and use Maven SDK exclusively via the command line using cd terminal or linux command prompt calls. First you'll need to create a basic pom.xml file, and the mvn -cpu command should start generating useful pom.xml files from the former pom.xml file. Reading into Maven resource structure may help users but if you follow this readme you may not have to do much work. This is my first Maven converted project and the .java files lose stability when the .jar file needs to be created, until the recent introduction of Maven. The point of this project is to be a template for Java developers who want to run servlets against jsp files, in my instance, an Amazon S3 bucket containing html that I would like to use rather than just copying my program over to a container. The application itself is meant to be a skeleton implementation of a 3D, Open GL binded game, which along side of the also portable DirectX language constitutes XBOX One and PS4 rendering coupled with a high speed SQL database that is shared between the application and the online forum.
